// ARCHIVED: Dead code related to the old selectedExercise system
// These state variables and functions are no longer used

STATE VARIABLES TO REMOVE:
- const [selectedExercise, setSelectedExercise] = useState<ExerciseWithProgress | null>(null)
- const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState('')
- const [weight, setWeight] = useState('')
- const [selectedIntensity, setSelectedIntensity] = useState<string | null>(null)

FUNCTIONS TO REMOVE:
- calculatePoints() function that uses selectedExercise
- handleSubmit() function that uses selectedExercise and quantity
- Any logic that sets selectedExercise

CURRENT SYSTEM USES:
- selectedWorkoutExercise + workoutInputOpen (the new system)
- workoutCount, selectedWeight, isDecreasedExercise (new state variables)
- calculateWorkoutPoints() function
- New submit logic in the workout input modal
